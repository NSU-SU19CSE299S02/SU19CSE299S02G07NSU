# Project Proposal

### Virtual Reading Room

<p align="justify">We want to develop an interactive web application which will create an environment/ bridge between student and teacher. This is a virtual reading room where student will get the opportunity to read the reading materials   given by the faculty member. 
Student and Faculty member canâ€™t meet physically all the times for some reasons. In this case, this application will help the faculty and faculty can provide reading task to the student. Student can be read the file uploaded by the faculty members. The virtual reading room helps the faculty member to create the report that a student has read the reading materials or not. It also shows how many times a student has read the given file.</p>

### Features:
* Faculty member can create a course and assign students to the corresponding course and section.
* Only registered users can access the courses.
* Users must have valid user ID and Password to access the system.
* In this system student can register a course and view the given reading materials.
* System of this product can detect student and reporting the faculty member that how many times a student read the file.
* A faculty member can view reporting details about actually who read that file and how long time a student spends to read that material.

### Propose technology:
* Django: We will use python web framework Django for the main development of the main web site because of the python enrich library.
* CSS,Javascript: We will use css, javascript for designing our website.
* Python: In our application, we will use python programming language for logical and arithmetic operation.



### Monetization:
<p align="justify">The target user of this application is mainly the student and faculty members of College, University. To use this application they can create a virtual reading room that helps their studies. We will try to launch this application and popularized to the users. We hope, we will get positive feedback from the users and we will go ahead and continue to service the users. There will be 2 versions for this software. <br>
<ul> Free version </ul>
<ul>	Pro/Paid version </ul>
Free version will contain every facility but with a limited usage. On the other hand, paid/pro version user can use all the facilities with no limit. There will be online financial service available like bKash, Ucash, Rocket. Users have to pay an amount to get the paid/pro version.
